# Challenge

This app is built with React (with create-react-app for a quick setup) and uses a local json file with trip data to populate a list of locations that can be sorted by check-in date and filtered by unit style.

## Setup

* Use `npm install` inside the insp-challenge directory to set up the app
* Use `npm run start` to launch it
